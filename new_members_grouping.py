### Welcome to the Family Grouping Page

This tool helps us assign new youth members to one of our existing family groups.

How it works:
- We take the list of pending members who have registered.
- Based on their **gender**, **age range**, and current **family sizes**,  
  they are evenly distributed into existing families.
- ‚úÖ Priority is currently given to **Family 2** to receive 3 more members.

üßæ Once assigned, new members are automatically moved to the Master Sheet and tagged with a timestamp.
