###  Welcome to the Family Grouping Page

This tool helps us assign new youth members to one of our existing family groups.

How it works:
- We take the list of pending members who have registered.
- Based on their gender, **age range, and current family sizes,
- They are evenly distributed into existing families.

üßæ Once assigned, new members are automatically moved to the Master Sheet and tagged with a timestamp so we can always tell who was recently added.
