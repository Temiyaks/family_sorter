### üëã Welcome to the Family Assignment Page

This tool helps us *assign new youth members* to one of our existing family groups.

üìå *How it works*:
- We take the list of pending members who have registered.
- Based on their *gender, **age range*, and current family sizes,
- They are *evenly distributed* into existing families.

üßæ Once assigned, new members are automatically moved to the *Master Sheet* and tagged with a timestamp so we can always tell who was recently added.
